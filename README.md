# End-to-End Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a retail superstore to identify profit leaks and growth opportunities. By combining **Python** for data processing and statistical analysis with **Power BI** for interactive visualization, I provided actionable insights into product performance and customer segmentation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Environment:** Anaconda Distribution (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and array handling.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing trends.
  - `scipy`: For statistical hypothesis testing (T-Test).
- **Business Intelligence:** Microsoft Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Interactive Dashboard).

## Key Insights & Findings
1. **Profitability Issue:** While "Tables" generate high revenue, they are sold at a **-20% loss** due to heavy discounting.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** The top 20% of customers contribute to **60% of total revenue**.
3. **Seasonality:** Sales consistently drop by 30% in January and February, suggesting a need for post-holiday marketing campaigns.
4. **Geographic Gaps:** Identified 3 specific states where shipping costs are eating into 100% of the profit margin.

## Project Structure
- `Sales_Analysis_Python.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code.
- `Sales_Dashboard.pbix`: The downloadable Power BI file.
- `Superstore_Cleaned.csv`: The processed dataset used for the dashboard.
